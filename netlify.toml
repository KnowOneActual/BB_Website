    # Content Security Policy (CSP) - CONSOLIDATED from _headers.txt and corrected for consistency
    # This CSP allows everything from your _headers.txt but with clean structure.
    # Note: 'unsafe-inline' is included for scripts and styles to allow Tailwind CDN & Three.js/any inline JS/CSS.
    # It weakens XSS protection slightly, but is often necessary for CDN-based frameworks.
