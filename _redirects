# Redirects file for Netlify

# Redirect Netlify's default success path to your custom thank-you page
/success /thank-you.html 200!

# Remove trailing slashes for clean URLs (optional, but good for SEO)
/:path/ /:path 301!

# Ensure your root domain (https://beaubremer.com/) also resolves to https://beaubremer.com
# Netlify often handles this automatically, but this can serve as a fallback if needed.
# Note: For the root domain, the `/:path/` rule above won't catch it directly.
# If you consistently want a non-trailing slash for the root, Netlify's default behavior usually ensures it.
# If you wanted to force the bare domain (non-slash) over the slash for the homepage:
# / /index.html 200
