## 2025-11-17 - Website Security Hardening & Review

* **Activity:** Ran a routine security review using multiple external scanners.
* **Tools Used:** Nuclei, Mozilla Observatory, securityheaders.com
* **Summary:** Scanned the live site and resolved several low-to-medium severity findings by hardening TLS configurations and adding new security headers.

---

### Changes Implemented

* **Disabled Deprecated TLS Versions**
    * **Action:** Set the "Minimum TLS Version" in the Cloudflare dashboard to **TLS 1.2**.
    * **Reason:** Scans detected that the server still accepted insecure TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols. This resolves `deprecated-tls` and `weak-cipher-suites` findings.

* **Added HTTP Security Headers**
    * **Action:** Added two new headers to the `[[headers]]` section in the `netlify.toml` file.
    * **Reason:** Scans flagged several missing headers. These two were added to improve security:
        * `cross-origin-resource-policy = "same-origin"`
        * `x-permitted-cross-domain-policies = "none"`

---

### Deliberate Exclusions (Findings Ignored)

* **Missing Subresource Integrity (SRI)**
    * **Reason:** Scanners flagged dynamic scripts from `challenges.cloudflare.com` (Turnstile) and `fonts.googleapis.com`. SRI hashes cannot be used for dynamic, third-party scripts, as the file content changes, which would break the site. This finding was ignored as expected.

* **Missing `cross-origin-embedder-policy` (COEP)**
    * **Reason:** This header is known to be restrictive and can break third-party embeds. It was left out to avoid breaking site functionality.

* **Missing `clear-site-data`**
    * **Reason:** This header is not a standard security header for all pages. It's a utility header used for specific actions (like logout), so the "missing" finding was ignored.

 ### Routine Dependency Audit

    Activity: Performed a routine dependency audit using npm audit.

    Tools Used: npm audit

Findings & Analysis

    Finding: The audit reported 12 vulnerabilities (7 high, 5 low) in packages like glob, fast-redact, and tmp.

    Analysis: All 12 vulnerabilities are transitive dependencies (dependencies of a dependency) and trace back to the netlify-cli package.

    Action Taken: Ran npm audit fix --force which was unable to resolve the issues. Also ran npm update netlify-cli to ensure the latest version was installed. The vulnerabilities persist in the latest version.

Conclusion & Risk Assessment

    Risk: The netlify-cli package is a build-time tool. These vulnerabilities do not affect the production runtime of the deployed website and pose no direct risk to end-users.

    Resolution: The fix must be implemented by the netlify-cli maintainers. Because the risk is low and contained to the local build environment, no further action can be taken. This finding is acknowledged and will be monitored for future package updates.
