      <p class="section-content" style="max-width: 800px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        Over the past few days, I've had the opportunity to significantly enhance the security, performance, and accessibility of my personal website, rgbsquared.com.  This project was guided by insights from various security scans (HostedScan, SecurityHeaders.com, pentest-tools.com) and performance audits (Google Lighthouse), as well as Nuclei, and a good old search engine, with help from an AI assistant (Gemini) to navigate the complexities. 
      </p>

      <div style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 4rem;">
        <h3 class="section-title" style="font-size: 1.8rem; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Key Improvements & Actions Taken:</h3> 

        <h4 class="section-title" style="font-size: 1.4rem; text-align: left; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">Robust HTTP Security Headers & Security Policy:</h4>
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
          **Action:** I implemented a comprehensive `vercel.json` file, meticulously defining crucial HTTP security headers.  Additionally, I established a `security.txt` file at `/.well-known/security.txt` to provide a clear vulnerability reporting channel. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          **Why it matters:** This setup provides a robust defense by: 
        </p>
        <ul class="section-content" style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>**Content-Security-Policy (CSP):** Establishing strict rules to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.  By whitelisting all allowed sources for scripts, styles, images, and other content, I significantly reduced the risk of malicious code execution. </li>
          <li>**X-Frame-Options (DENY):** Preventing clickjacking by disallowing my site from being embedded in iframes on other domains. </li>
          <li>**X-Content-Type-Options (nosniff):** Mitigating MIME-sniffing attacks, which helps prevent browsers from misinterpreting file types. </li>
          <li>**Referrer-Policy (no-referrer-when-downgrade):** Enhancing user privacy by controlling how much referrer information is sent with requests. </li>
          <li>**Permissions-Policy:** Explicitly disabling unwanted browser features (like geolocation, microphone, camera) to enhance user privacy and security. </li>
          <li>**security.txt:** This standardized file demonstrates a proactive stance on security, offering a designated and easily discoverable channel for security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.  It highlights a commitment to security best practices and responsible disclosure. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="section-title" style="font-size: 1.4rem; text-align: left; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">Code Refactoring for Enhanced Security & Maintainability:</h4>
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
          **Action:** I moved all inline JavaScript and CSS from the `index.html` file into dedicated external files (`script.js` and `style.css`).  Additionally, JavaScript event handlers (e.g., `onsubmit`, `onclick`) were refactored to be attached programmatically in `script.js`. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          **Why it matters:** This change was crucial. It allowed me to remove the potentially dangerous 'unsafe-inline' directive from the CSP for my custom code, significantly reducing the XSS attack surface.  It also greatly improved code organization, readability, and overall maintainability. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-title" style="font-size: 1.4rem; text-align: left; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">Major Performance Optimization (Removing Unnecessary Payload):</h4>
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
          **Action:** A critical performance issue was identified: an unintended 4.1 MB text file (`block.txt`) was being loaded from GitHub on every page visit.  I successfully eliminated this reference.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          **Why it matters:** This removal dramatically reduced the total page size from nearly 5 MB to less than 1 MB.  This directly translated to much faster loading times and a significantly better user experience for visitors, especially on mobile devices. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-title" style="font-size: 1.4rem; text-align: left; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">Accessibility Enhancements:</h4>
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
          **Action:** I addressed color contrast issues in the footer text by adjusting its color for better readability on a dark background.  I also implemented the `<main>` HTML5 semantic tag to properly structure the main content of the page. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          **Why it matters:** These improvements ensure that my site is more accessible to users with visual impairments and those using assistive technologies, providing a better experience for all visitors. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-title" style="font-size: 1.4rem; text-align: left; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">Favicon Reliability:</h4>
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
          **Action:** I updated the favicon link to point to a standard `favicon.ico` file. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          **Why it matters:** This resolved an `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` console error previously seen in Lighthouse, ensuring the favicon loads reliably. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title" style="font-size: 1.8rem; text-align: left; margin-top: 4rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Why Some Items Were Not Fully Addressed (Practical Considerations):</h3> 

        <h4 class="section-title" style="font-size: 1.4rem; text-align: left; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">'unsafe-inline' in CSP (Persistent Warning):</h4>
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          While I eliminated 'unsafe-inline' for my custom code, it remains in the CSP for specific third-party integrations like Google reCAPTCHA and Tailwind CSS (from their CDN).  These services dynamically inject small amounts of inline script and style.  Implementing CSP nonces or hashes for such dynamically generated third-party resources is technically complex for a static site hosted on Vercel, often requiring server-side logic.  For a personal portfolio, the robust domain whitelisting in my Content Security Policy (CSP) provides strong protection, making this a pragmatic and acceptable compromise for functionality. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-title" style="font-size: 1.4rem; text-align: left; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Tailwind CSS:</h4> 
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          My attempts to add SRI to the Tailwind CSS CDN link were unsuccessful because the CDN's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers are not configured to support SRI requests.  As this is a server-side limitation of the CDN, it cannot be fixed from my end.  However, the explicit whitelisting of `cdn.tailwindcss.com` in my CSP still ensures that only the legitimate Tailwind CSS from that trusted domain can be loaded. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-title" style="font-size: 1.4rem; text-align: left; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens:</h4> 
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          My contact form utilizes Formspree, a third-party service that typically handles CSRF protection on their backend.  For a simple contact form that doesn't process sensitive data, this is an acceptable delegation of responsibility to a trusted service. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title" style="font-size: 1.8rem; text-align: left; margin-top: 4rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Outcome:</h3> 
        <p class="section-content" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          Working through these challenges, I've significantly improved my website's overall quality.  Recent Google Lighthouse audits now proudly reflect: 
        </p>
        <ul class="section-content" style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>**Performance:** Drastically improved (score now **0.97**, previously **0.76**). </li>
          <li>**Accessibility:** A perfect score of **1**. </li>
          <li>**Best Practices:** A perfect score of **1**.</li>
          <li>**SEO:** A perfect score of **1**.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="section-content">
          This work demonstrates my strong understanding and practical application of modern web development best practices, including security, performance optimization, and accessibility standards.
