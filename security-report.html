      <div class="card p-6">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">1. Robust HTTP Security Headers (_headers Configuration) &
          Security Policy:</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          <span class="font-bold">Action:</span> I implemented a comprehensive `_headers` file for Netlify, meticulously
          defining crucial HTTP security headers. Additionally, I established a `security.txt` file at
          `/.well-known/security.txt` to provide a clear vulnerability reporting channel.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> This setup provides a robust defense by:

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Content-Security-Policy (CSP):</span> Establishing strict rules to prevent
            Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. By whitelisting all allowed sources for scripts,
            styles, images, and other content, I significantly reduced the risk of malicious code execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">X-Frame-Options (DENY):</span> Preventing clickjacking by disallowing my site
            from being embedded in iframes on other domains.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">X-Content-Type-Options (nosniff):</span> Mitigating MIME-sniffing attacks, which
            helps prevent browsers from misinterpreting file types.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Referrer-Policy (no-referrer-when-downgrade):</span> Enhancing user privacy by
            controlling how much referrer information is sent with requests.

          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Permissions-Policy:</span> Explicitly disabling unwanted browser features (like
            geolocation, microphone, camera) to enhance user privacy and security.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">security.txt:</span> This standardized file demonstrates a proactive stance on
            security, offering a designated and easily discoverable channel for security researchers to report
            vulnerabilities responsibly. It highlights a commitment to security best practices and responsible
            disclosure.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">2. Code Refactoring for Enhanced Security & Maintainability:
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          <span class="font-bold">Action:</span> I moved all inline JavaScript and CSS from the `index.html` file into
          dedicated external files (`script.js` and `style.css`). Additionally, JavaScript event handlers (e.g.,
          `onsubmit`, `onclick`) were refactored to be attached programmatically in `script.js`.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> This change was crucial. It allowed me to remove the
          potentially dangerous `'unsafe-inline'` directive from the CSP for my custom code, significantly reducing the
          XSS attack surface. It also greatly improved code organization, readability, and overall maintainability.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">3. Major Performance Optimization (Removing Unnecessary
          Payload):</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          <span class="font-bold">Action:</span> A critical performance issue was identified: an unintended 4.1 MB text
          file (`block.txt`) was being loaded from GitHub on every page visit. I successfully eliminated this reference.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> This removal dramatically reduced the total page size from
          nearly 5 MB to less than 1 MB. This directly translated to much faster loading times and a significantly
          better user experience for visitors, especially on mobile devices.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">4. Accessibility Enhancements:</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          <span class="font-bold">Action:</span> I addressed color contrast issues in the footer text by adjusting its
          color for better readability on a dark background. I also implemented the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> HTML5
          semantic tag to properly structure the main content of the page.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> These improvements ensure my site is more accessible to users
          with visual impairments and assistive technologies, providing a better experience for all visitors.

        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          <span class="font-bold">Action:</span> I updated the favicon link to point to a standard `favicon.ico` file.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> This resolved an `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` console error
          previously seen in Lighthouse, ensuring the favicon loads reliably.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold fuchsia-text mb-4">Why Some Items Were Not Fully Addressed (Practical
          Considerations):</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">'unsafe-inline' in CSP (Persistent Warning):</span> While I eliminated
            `'unsafe-inline'` for my custom code, it remains in the CSP for specific third-party integrations like
            Google reCAPTCHA and Tailwind CSS (from their CDN). These services dynamically inject small amounts of
            inline script and style. Implementing CSP nonces or hashes for such dynamically generated third-party
            resources is technically complex for a static site hosted on Netlify, often requiring server-side logic. For
            a personal portfolio, the robust domain whitelisting in my CSP provides strong protection, making this a
            pragmatic and acceptable compromise for functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Tailwind CSS:</span> My attempts to add SRI to
            the Tailwind CSS CDN link were unsuccessful because the CDN's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers
            are not configured to support SRI requests. As this is a server-side limitation of the CDN, it cannot be
            fixed from my end. However, the explicit whitelisting of `cdn.tailwindcss.com` in my CSP still ensures that
            only the legitimate Tailwind CSS from that trusted domain can be loaded.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens:</span> My contact form utilizes Formspree, a
            third-party service that typically handles CSRF protection on their backend. For a simple contact form that
            doesn't process sensitive data, this is an acceptable delegation of responsibility to a trusted service.
